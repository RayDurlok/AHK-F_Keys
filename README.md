This is a neat AHK script to utilise your F1-F12 keys to launch programs, websites and folder paths. When you run it it will show up as a little desktop item on the right side of your taskbar. 
I used scripts from https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/102127-navigating-explorer-directories/ and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774094 for the basic functions. 

Use Hotkeys CTRL + I to insert your paths, website links or programm paths to launch them with your F Keys. 
If youre lauching the script for the first time, use the create ini button to create an .ini file in the path where the script is saved, to store the paths and links.

For websites just insert the links.
For folder paths insert the path. 
For programms use /pathtotheprogramm/nameoftheprogramm.exe (or other extensions)

For suspending the hotkeys use the insert button.
For exiting the script use CTRL + insert. 

Feel free to further edit the script or give me feedback. 

In order to run this script you need AHK to be installed, use https://www.autohotkey.com/ to download it.


There is one additional function to insert your paths into the "save file as" or "save download" dialog. I will make a tutorial for that soon. Currently only works with Windows10 when you screenshot the little down arrow at the right side of the explorer window and save it under explorer1.png where the script is located. For an alternative appearance of the arrow use explorer2.png.
