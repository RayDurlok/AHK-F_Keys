This is a neat AHK script to utilise your F1-F12 keys to launch programs, websites and folder paths. 
I used scripts from https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/102127-navigating-explorer-directories/ and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774094 for the basic functions. 

Use Hotkeys CTRL + I to insert your paths, website links or programm paths to launch them with your F Keys. 
If youre lauching the script for the first time, use the create ini button to create an .ini file in the path where the script is saved, to store the paths and links.

For websites just insert the links.
For folder paths insert the path. 
For programms use /pathtotheprogramm/nameoftheprogramm.exe (or other extensions)

For suspending the hotkeys use the insert button+F12
For exiting the script use CTRL + insert. 

Feel free to further edit the script or give me feedback.
